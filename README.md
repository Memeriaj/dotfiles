# My Dotfiles

Just all of my dotfiles set up in such a way that things can be run idempotently and are organized in a nice way.

## Usage

Clone the repo via `git clone git@github.com:memeriaj/dotfiles.git`

Then run `./bootstrap.py` to put the dot files in the correct locations.

## Inspiration

This setup was inspired by [ryanpbrewster](https://github.com/ryanpbrewster/config) but was cloned from [rockwotj](https://github.com/rockwotj/dotfiles) (who also got it from the same place).
